# 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain, FAISS, and Hugging Face

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and **Hugging Face Embeddings** to enhance language models with custom knowledge from local documents.

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 PDF Document Loading using `PyMuPDF`
- 🧩 Text Splitting and Chunking for better retrieval
- 🔍 Embedding generation using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`
- 📚 Vector storage and similarity search with **FAISS**
- 🤖 Retrieval-augmented question answering using LangChain
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebook interface for testing and experimentation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- LangChain – Framework for building LLM apps with memory, agents, tools, etc.

- FAISS – Facebook AI similarity search for efficient vector indexing

- HuggingFaceEmbeddings – To convert text into embeddings

## 📌 How It Works

- Load Documents – PDF files are loaded using LangChain's PyMuPDFLoader.

- Split into Chunks – Documents are split into small chunks with overlap using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

- Generate Embeddings – Each chunk is embedded into a high-dimensional vector space.

- Store in FAISS – These embeddings are stored in a FAISS index for similarity search.

- Ask Questions – A user query is embedded and matched with similar chunks.

- Generate Answer – The retrieved chunks are passed to an LLM to generate a context-aware answer.

## 🧠 Sample Prompt

```python
query = "What is RAG and how does it improve LLMs?"
```

The system searches relevant PDF chunks and uses them to provide an accurate and grounded response from the LLM.

## 📈 Use Cases
